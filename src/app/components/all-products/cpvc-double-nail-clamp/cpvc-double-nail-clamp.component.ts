This innovative design ensures superior stability for hot water pipes, prevents movement during thermal expansion, and distributes load more evenly to prevent wall damage. The heat-resistant CPVC material can withstand temperatures up to 93Â°C, making these clamps ideal for hot water systems where standard clamps might fail."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "For optimal support and performance, we recommend installing CPVC double nail clamps at intervals of 80-100cm for horizontal pipe runs. For vertical runs, spacing of 100-120cm is typically sufficient. However, for hot water applications where thermal expansion is significant, reducing spacing to 60-80cm may provide better support. Always follow local plumbing codes and specific project requirements when determining exact spacing."

However, for hot water applications, CPVC clamps are recommended due to their superior temperature resistance. The silicone cushioning insert prevents pipe damage and accommodates slight variations in pipe diameter, making them versatile for various plastic pipe systems."
