            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "CPVC concealed valves are modern plumbing fixtures made from Chlorinated Polyvinyl Chloride that control water flow in shower systems while remaining hidden behind walls. They offer several advantages over traditional brass valves, including superior chemical resistance (particularly to chlorine in water supply), better insulation properties (reducing heat loss in hot water), elimination of lead contamination concerns, resistance to scale buildup, and typically lower cost. CPVC valves are also lighter, easier to install, and don't corrode or develop pinhole leaks like metal valves can over time."

            "text": "Our CPVC concealed valves are engineered for exceptional durability and typically have a service life of 20-25 years under normal usage conditions. This longevity is due to the high-quality CPVC material that resists chemical degradation, scale buildup, and corrosion. The ceramic disc cartridge technology ensures smooth operation for thousands of cycles. Proper installation and water quality can further extend the valve's lifespan. We provide a 7-year warranty on all our CPVC concealed valves, reflecting our confidence in their long-term performance."

They feature standard connection sizes (15mm, 20mm, and 25mm) that work with most popular shower trims, handles, and diverters available in the Indian market. The valves use industry-standard cartridge dimensions, allowing you to mix and match with various decorative trim kits from major manufacturers. For specialized installations or unique fixture compatibility, we offer adapter solutions and technical support to ensure proper integration. Our installation guides provide detailed compatibility information for major fixture brands."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Diverter valves redirect water flow between multiple outlets (like a handheld shower, overhead rain shower, or body jets) without affecting temperature or pressure. Mixer valves combine hot and cold water inputs to achieve the desired temperature through a single manual control, requiring you to adjust the mix each time. Thermostatic valves are the most advanced, automatically maintaining your preset temperature regardless of pressure fluctuations in the water supply system and preventing scalding with safety stops. We offer all three types in our CPVC concealed valve range to suit different bathroom configurations and user preferences, with thermostatic options providing the highest level of comfort and safety."

            "text": "Our CPVC concealed valves are designed with modern thin-wall construction techniques in mind. The standard installation depth is 50-70mm from the finished wall surface, making them suitable for most contemporary bathroom installations. We provide adjustable installation cassettes with our premium models that allow for depth adjustments during installation, accommodating wall thicknesses between 40-100mm. This flexibility ensures proper fitting even when wall specifications change during construction. Each valve comes with detailed installation templates and depth guides to ensure correct positioning."
